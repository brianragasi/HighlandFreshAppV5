Based on the discussion, the **Maintenance Head** (or **Head Maintenance**) is the "Operational Custodian" of the plant’s physical assets. While they are not involved in the milk-making process itself, their function is to ensure the **Retort, Homogenizer, and Fill-Seal machines** never stop running by managing the tools and spare parts required for repairs.

Here is the comprehensive function of the **Maintenance Head** as discussed:

### 1. Internal Requisition of Spare Parts (MRO)
The Maintenance Head acts as a specialized "customer" of the warehouse. As discussed (at 32:55), they are responsible for the "MRO" (Maintenance, Repair, and Operations) inventory.
*   **Requesting Parts:** When a repair is needed, the Maintenance Head initiates a digital request for hardware, specifically mentioned as **"bolts" (buli/bolt)**, machine oil, or other spare parts.
*   **Adhering to the "Evidence Rule":** They cannot simply walk into the warehouse and take a part. They must follow the formal flow: **Input Request $\rightarrow$ Wait for GM Approval $\rightarrow$ Receive Item from Warehouse.**

### 2. Technical Procurement Assistance
Since the plant uses highly specialized dairy machinery, the Maintenance Head provides the technical data the Purchaser needs to buy the right items.
*   **Purchase Requesting (PRS):** If a specific part is not in stock (like a specialized seal for the pasteurizer), the Maintenance Head initiates a **Purchase Request Slip (PRS)**.
*   **Specifying Requirements:** They ensure the Purchaser knows exactly what to "manawag" (call) the suppliers for, ensuring the technical specs of the hardware match the machines in the plant.

### 3. Machine Health & Repair Logging
The Maintenance Head is responsible for the "Life History" of the company’s expensive equipment.
*   **Repair Documentation:** They document every repair made to the **Retort machine, the Homogenizer, or the Fill-Seal machine**.
*   **Asset Tracking:** By logging when a "bolt" or a part was used, they help the system track the maintenance history of each machine, which is a critical requirement for **FDA and safety compliance**.

### 4. Categorization of Maintenance Inventory
Ma’am emphasized that maintenance supplies should not be mixed with food ingredients. The Maintenance Head works with the Warehouse Raw custodian to:
*   **Subdivide the Warehouse:** Ensure that the "Maintenance" category is separate from "Ingredients" or "Packaging."
*   **Inventory Auditing:** Periodically checking the stock levels of essential repair items to ensure the plant doesn't experience "downtime" because a simple bolt was out of stock.

### 5. Cost Attribution (Maintenance vs. Production)
The Maintenance Head ensures that repair costs are recorded correctly in the Bookkeeping module.
*   **Expense Separation:** By tagging a requisition as "Maintenance," they ensure the **Bookkeeper** doesn't accidentally count a machine part as a "Cost of Goods Sold" (like sugar or milk).
*   **Repair Costing:** They help the GM see the "Trend" of how much it costs to keep the plant running versus how much it costs to produce the milk.

### 6. Safety & Plant Layout Compliance
The Maintenance Head ensures the physical plant follows the **"One-Way Flow"** rule discussed by Ma'am.
*   **Infrastructure Maintenance:** Ensuring that the ramps, partitions, and machine placements remain compliant with the safety standards required for dairy production.
*   **PPE Management:** Requesting and managing the tools and safety gear (PPE) needed for the maintenance crew to work safely in a food-production environment.

### Summary
In the Highland Fresh system, the **Maintenance Head’s function is "Technical Reliability."** They ensure that the plant stays operational by strictly managing the **inventory of spare parts** and documenting every repair through the formal **GM approval and Warehouse requisition** workflow.
