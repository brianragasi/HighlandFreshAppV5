Based on the discussion, the **Cashier** is the primary "Financial Hub" for daily operations. Their function is focused on **liquidity**—handling physical cash, digital payments, and the collection of outstanding debts.

Here is the comprehensive function of the **Cashier** as discussed:

### 1. Point of Sale (POS) for Walk-in Customers
The Cashier is responsible for all "Individual" sales. While the Sales Custodian handles big supermarkets, the Cashier handles the retail side.
*   **Quick Action UI:** Ma’am requested a "Quick Action" or "Quick Cash" interface so the Cashier can process walk-in sales quickly without navigating complex order screens.
*   **Transaction Entry:** Inputting the Walk-in Customer name (or generic "Walk-in"), selecting products, and recording the total amount paid.
*   **Retail Inventory Deduction:** Their sales action must instantly "less" (deduct) the products from the Finished Goods inventory.

### 2. Debt Collection & AR Settlement
A major function of the Cashier is to act as the collection point for credit accounts.
*   **Search by DR Number:** When a customer or collector arrives to pay for a previous delivery, the Cashier must be able to search the **DR (Delivery Receipt) Number** to pull up the outstanding balance.
*   **Closing the Loop:** Once payment is received, the Cashier marks it in the system so the debt "reflects" as paid in the Sales Custodian’s aging report.
*   **Staggered Payments:** Handling partial payments (e.g., a customer owes ₱1M but pays ₱500k) and ensuring the system tracks the remaining balance.

### 3. Management of Payment Metadata
The Cashier is responsible for the accuracy of non-cash payment records. As discussed, they must record:
*   **Payment Type:** Differentiating between **Cash, GCash, Bank Transfer, and Checks.**
*   **Validation Data:** Recording **Check Numbers, Issuing Banks, Account Owners, and Maturity Dates.**
*   **Reference Numbers:** Capturing GCash or Bank Transfer reference IDs to assist the Bookkeeper with reconciliation.

### 4. Generation of Sales Invoices (SI)
The Cashier is the primary issuer of daily sales documentation.
*   **SI Issuance:** Ma’am clarified that the **Sales Invoice (SI)** is the Cashier's document for direct transactions.
*   **CSI Reconciliation:** While the **Charge Sales Invoice (CSI)** is for market deliveries, the Cashier uses the data from the CSI to process the final payment when the money arrives.

### 5. Daily Reconciliation & the "5:00 PM Rule"
The Cashier is governed by a strict timeline to ensure financial integrity.
*   **Daily Cut-off:** All transactions must be entered and reconciled by **5:00 PM**.
*   **Reporting:** Providing the daily "hagsa" (automated entry) to the Bookkeeper, ensuring that the physical cash in the drawer matches the digital sales recorded for the day.

### 6. Internal "Staff Credit" Management
The Cashier also manages small-scale internal accounts.
*   **Employee Purchases:** Recording when staff members (like "Sir Irwin") purchase items like milk or meals on credit.
*   **Payment Tracking:** Ensuring these internal debts are eventually paid or properly documented for Finance to deduct from payroll.

### 7. Non-Dairy Product Sales
The Cashier handles the retail sale of the "Other" products mentioned by Ma'am.
*   **Miscellaneous Inventory:** Selling items like **Alcohol, CMT, Jelly, or Powders** that are kept in the store, ensuring these non-dairy items are also tracked in the inventory.

### Summary
In the Highland Fresh system, the **Cashier’s function is "Revenue Integrity."** They ensure that every peso—whether from a walk-in bottle of milk, a staff meal, or a million-peso supermarket check—is recorded accurately, categorized by payment type, and reconciled before the daily 5:00 PM cut-off.
