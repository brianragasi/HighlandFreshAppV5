Based on the discussion, the **Purchaser** is the "Procurement and Sourcing Officer" of Highland Fresh. Their function is to act as the primary link between the company’s internal needs (Production, Maintenance, Warehouse) and external suppliers, ensuring that all purchases are validated, approved, and tracked for price trends.

Here is the comprehensive function of the **Purchaser** as discussed:

### 1. Requisition Validation & Sourcing
The Purchaser is the first point of contact when a department needs to spend money.
*   **Need Verification:** When Production needs sugar or Maintenance needs a bolt, they send a request to the Purchaser.
*   **Inventory Cross-Check:** Before buying, the Purchaser must coordinate with the **Warehouse Custodian** to verify if the item is truly out of stock. As Ma'am noted, they shouldn't buy what the company already has.
*   **Canvassing:** While not detailed in depth, the Purchaser is responsible for identifying where to buy the materials (e.g., finding suppliers like "Great Harvest").

### 2. Purchase Order (PO) Management
The Purchaser is the owner of the formal "Buy" document.
*   **PO Creation:** They translate approved requests into a formal **Purchase Order (PO)**.
*   **Term Specification:** They must identify if the purchase is **"Cash"** or **"Utang" (Credit)**. This is a critical functional requirement because it dictates how the Finance Officer will eventually process the payment.
*   **Supplier Communication:** Ma'am mentioned that for raw materials, the Purchaser **"manawag" (calls)** the suppliers to confirm current market prices and availability before finalizing the order.

### 3. Approval Workflow Navigation
The Purchaser manages the strict hierarchy of spending discussed in the audio.
*   **GM Approval:** The Purchaser does **not** have the authority to approve a buy. They prepare the documents and must wait for the **General Manager’s** digital signature.
*   **Finance Coordination:** Once the GM approves, the Purchaser notifies the Finance Officer that an obligation has been created, so the money can be prepared for the upcoming bill.

### 4. Price Trend Monitoring & Analysis
This was a major concern for Ma'am regarding the system's ability to track market shifts.
*   **Ingredient Price Entry:** The Purchaser is responsible for inputting the **Price per Ingredient** and **Price per Packaging** unit into the system.
*   **Trend Tracking:** They must update the system when prices fluctuate—for example, if a sack of sugar jumps from **₱8,000 to ₱9,000**. 
*   **Production Cost Feedback:** By keeping prices updated, the Purchaser provides the GM with the "Trend" data needed to understand how raw material costs are affecting the total cost of finished products.

### 5. Document Handling (PRS, PO, RR)
The Purchaser manages the "Paper Trail" (which the students are digitizing).
*   **PRS (Purchase Request Slip):** Managing the initial internal request.
*   **Receiving Report (RR) Verification:** When the goods arrive at the Warehouse, the Purchaser ensures the items delivered match the PO they issued.
*   **Manual-to-Digital Transition:** They are responsible for moving the manual "logbooks" into the new digital system to ensure no record is lost.

### 6. Maintenance & Non-Production Procurement
The Purchaser handles more than just food ingredients.
*   **MRO Procurement:** Sourcing spare parts and hardware for the plant (e.g., bolts, machine oil, tools).
*   **Office & Marketing Supplies:** Sourcing fuel for delivery trucks, office supplies, and PPE, ensuring these costs are categorized correctly.

### Summary
In the Highland Fresh system, the **Purchaser’s function is "Procurement Control and Cost Analysis."** They ensure the company never buys unnecessary stock, that every purchase is authorized by the General Manager, and that the system always reflects the most current market prices of raw materials to track the company’s "Price Trends."
