Based on the discussion, the **Sales Custodian** is the "Account Manager" for Highland Fresh's large-scale, institutional, and wholesale clients. Their function is distinct from the Cashier because they don't focus on physical cash; instead, they focus on **Purchase Orders (POs), credit accounts, institutional relationships, wholesaler management, and customer order oversight.**

Here is the comprehensive function of the **Sales Custodian** as discussed:

---

## A. INSTITUTIONAL & CREDIT SALES MANAGEMENT

### 1. Management of Institutional & Credit Sales
While the Cashier handles walk-in individuals, the Sales Custodian is responsible for "Big" clients. As discussed, this includes:
*   **Supermarkets & Malls:** Managing sales for outlets like SM, Robinsons, and Gaisano.
*   **Companies & Cafes:** Handling wholesale or regular credit-based orders.
*   **Government Accounts:** Managing the "Feeding Program" sales (e.g., DepEd).

### 2. PO (Purchase Order) Processing
The Sales Custodian is the primary user responsible for translating customer requests into system data.
*   **Receiving POs:** They are the "receiver" of the official Purchase Orders sent by supermarkets.
*   **Data Entry:** They input the PO details into the system—specifically "how much was ordered" vs. "how much was actually received" by the client.
*   **Order Fulfillment Coordination:** They ensure the order is recorded so that the Warehouse (Finished Goods) knows what to release.

### 3. "Aging" & Debt Monitoring
Because their primary domain is **Credit Sales (Utang)**, the Sales Custodian is responsible for monitoring the financial health of customer accounts.
*   **Balance Tracking:** Keeping track of what each institution owes.
*   **Aging Reports:** Monitoring the "Aging" of debt, specifically categorized into **30 days, 60 days, and 90+ days (Overdue).** This ensures the company knows which clients are late on payments.

### 4. Customer Hierarchy & Sub-Name Logic
The Sales Custodian manages complex customer structures, especially for government contracts.
*   **Sub-Categorization:** For a customer like **DepEd**, the Sales Custodian must be able to input "Sub-names" or "Descriptions."
*   **School-Based Tracking:** They ensure that while the "Customer" is DepEd, the system reflects which specific school (e.g., a school in Cagayan de Oro) received the delivery.

### 5. Credit Documentation (CSI & DR)
The Sales Custodian handles the documentation required for deliveries where cash is not exchanged immediately.
*   **Charge Sales Invoices (CSI):** They oversee the generation of "Charge" invoices for market deliveries.
*   **DR (Delivery Receipt) Linking:** They ensure the PO is linked to a Delivery Receipt number so the Cashier can find it later for collection.

### 6. Sales Monitoring & Fluctuation
Ma'am mentioned that she monitors sales weekly to adjust production. The Sales Custodian provides the data for this:
*   **Weekly Monitoring:** Identifying if a supermarket's sales are *"kusog"* (strong) or *"hinay"* (weak).
*   **Order Adjustments:** Based on these trends, they help decide whether to "add" more stock to a specific mall or "reduce" the delivery volume for the following week.

## B. CUSTOMER DIRECT ORDERING MANAGEMENT

### 7. Customer Self-Service Order Portal Oversight
Small stores (sari-sari stores) now order directly through the web portal instead of through drivers. The Sales Custodian manages this process:

*   **Order Queue Monitoring:** View all incoming orders from the customer portal in real-time.
*   **Order Validation:** Review orders for accuracy, product availability, and delivery feasibility.
*   **Order Status Management:** Update order status through the fulfillment pipeline:
    - **Pending** – Order received, awaiting review

    - **Cancelled** – Order cancelled (with reason tracking)
*   **Communication:** Notify customers of order status changes, delays, or issues.
*   **Delivery Scheduling:** Assign orders to delivery routes/schedules.

### 8. Customer Account Management
The Sales Custodian maintains customer profiles for portal users:

*   **Customer Classification:** Categorize customers by type (Sari-sari Store, Retailer, Wholesaler, Institutional).
*   **Credit Limit Assignment:** Set credit limits based on customer payment history and volume.
