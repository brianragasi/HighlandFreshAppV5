Based on the discussion in the transcript, the **General Manager (GM)**—frequently referred to as "Ma'am"—is the strategic and administrative center of Highland Fresh. 

Her function is not to perform daily data entry, but to **control, approve, and analyze** every aspect of the business. Here is the comprehensive function of the General Manager as discussed:

### 1. Ultimate Approval Authority (The "Final Say")
The most emphasized function in the audio is that the GM is the **exclusive gatekeeper for all expenditures.** 
*   **Purchasing Approval:** The Purchaser prepares a request, but the GM must provide the final digital signature before a Purchase Order (PO) is sent.
*   **Inventory Requisition:** Even for internal needs (like the Maintenance Head needing a bolt or Production needing sugar), the GM must approve the digital "Requisition Slip" before the Warehouse is allowed to release the item.

### 2. Master Data & Recipe Ownership
The GM is responsible for the **Financial Logic** of the production line.
*   **Master Recipe Control:** Only the GM has the authority to define the "Standard Ratios" for products (e.g., exactly how much sugar, powder, and milk go into a 330ml Choco Milk). This is her tool for controlling costs and preventing "leakage" or theft of ingredients.
*   **Pricing Authority:** She sets the "Plant Price" for finished goods and determines the "Incentive/Deduction" formulas for farmer milk grading.

### 3. Strategic Market Analysis & Monitoring
The GM monitors the external environment to make operational adjustments.
*   **Price Trend Monitoring:** She tracks the fluctuating costs of raw materials (e.g., noting when a sack of sugar jumps from ₱8,000 to ₱9,000) to understand how it affects profit margins.
*   **Sales Performance Oversight:** She monitors supermarkets (SM, Robinsons, Gaisano) to see if sales are *"kusog"* (strong) or *"hinay"* (weak). She uses this data to tell Production to either "add" more stock or "reduce" the daily volume.

### 4. Financial Performance Review
The GM is the primary "consumer" of the system's reporting capabilities.
*   **Four Financial Statements:** She specifically requested the real-time generation of the Income Statement, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow, and Statement of Equity to monitor the company's health.
*   **Accounts Receivable (AR) Oversight:** She uses the **Aging Report** to identify which large institutional clients (malls/supermarkets) are failing to pay on time and requires high-level visibility over "staggered payments."

### 5. Compliance & Operational Standards
The GM is responsible for the company’s legal and safety standing.
*   **FDA Compliance:** She oversees the "One-Way Flow" logic of the plant layout to ensure the facility meets regulatory safety standards.
*   **The 5 PM Rule:** She enforces the daily cut-off and reconciliation to ensure that the Cashier’s physical money always matches the Finance module's digital records.

### 6. Resource & Asset Management
*   **MRO Oversight:** She monitors the Maintenance Head’s requests for spare parts and machine repairs (Retort, Homogenizer, etc.) to ensure the plant’s assets are being maintained without overspending.
*   **Hardware Strategy:** As mentioned in the audio, she is the one who decides on and procures the physical POS hardware and ensures the software team integrates it correctly.

### Summary
In the Highland Fresh system, the **General Manager’s function is "Decision-Making through Data."** She relies on the "Hagsa" (automated) logic so that she can stop worrying about re-typing records and start focusing on **approving requests, managing costs, and growing the business.**
